Welcome to my very first Website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

# Project Description
This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program.
# Technology
This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
